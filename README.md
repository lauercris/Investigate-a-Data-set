# Investigate a Data set.
​	I analyzed a data set from Brazil about show scheduled appointments. The goal was to create a visualization and 

prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between people who shows and people who doesn't show in appointments.
        I download (CSV) file from https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments. Data has been cleaned and analyzed using 
     IPython Notebook (Jupyter).
    • Visualizing data with matplotlib. • Analyzing the data.
